## Using docker command 

Docker containers are built from Docker images. By default, Docker pulls these images from Docker Hub, a Docker registry
managed by Docker, the company behind the Docker project. Anyone can host their Docker images on Docker Hub, so most 
applications and Linux distributions youâ€™ll need will have images hosted there.

1. Run sample container from Docker Hub on all node
```shell
docker run hello-world
```

2. pull image from Docker Ubuntu 20.04 on node 1
```shell
docker pull ubuntu:20.04
```

3. pull image from docker alpine 3.17 on node 2
```shell
docker pull alpine:3.17
```

## Task
- Run sample container from Docker Hub on all node
- make sure ubuntu 20.04 is pulled on node 1
- make sure alpine 3.17 is pulled on node 2
